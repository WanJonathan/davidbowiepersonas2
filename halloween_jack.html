			<p class="description1 jackcolor explanationpage">For Bowie's eighth studio album, a persona was crafted to support the album and the subsequent tour. This persona was Halloween Jack, a Ziggy look-a-like and a resident of the fictional dystopian "Hunger City" which was featured in Bowie's eventual eighth studio album, <i>Diamond Dogs</i>. This was the last step for Bowie's glam rock journey as Halloween Jack was his last glam rock persona, following the wildly successful Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.</p>

			<h2 class="headingright jackheadercolor">Origins</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright jackcolor">Like his previous persona of Aladdin Sane, Halloween Jack was heavily inspired by the iconography and fashion of Ziggy Stardust. For example, Jack's red mullet was directly copied from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane. However, another piece was introduced to the puzzle of Halloween Jack that differentiated the persona from his other glam rock incarnations. This piece was the fact that Bowie wanted to develop George Orwell's dystopian fiction <i>1984</i> into a musical for television. Though Bowie got denied the rights for the musical, the idea itself was ingrained into both Halloween Jack and Bowie's upcoming album which was heavily inspired by Orwell's book. While Ziggy and Aladdin were aliens, Jack would be an citizen oppressed by the regime controlling his world.</p>

			<h2><br></h2>
			<h2 class="headingright jackheadercolor">Description</h2>
			<p class="descriptionright jackcolor">Halloween Jack dons a red mullet and looks reminiscent of a pirate, since Jack always wears an eyepatch on his right eye. This is probably a spin on the Ziggy Stardust look, with the depiction of Jack being more rugged and rough to fit in with the dystopian city he lives in. In Hunger City, Jack has learned to live with the chaotic, lawless nature of the city and lives underground to avoid pillaging gangs. Not much is known about Jack's personality though.</p>

			<h2 class="headingleft jackheadercolor">In Music</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft jackcolor">Halloween Jack was Bowie's persona during the creation of his album <span class="italic">Diamond Dogs</span>, a mix of Bowie's original vision for a <span class="italic">1984</span> inspired musical, his old glam rock sound and a new sprinkling of American soul. The album did not end up doing as well as his other glam rock albums <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</span> and <span class="italic">Aladdin Sane</span>, however it was still received well by critics and it did spawn a massive, career-defining hit with "Rebel Rebel".</p>

			<h2 class="headingleft jackheadercolor">Appearances</h2>
			<p class="descriptionleft jackcolor">Halloween Jack made appearances in public and on tour in 1974. One of his most notable appearances occured on the show "Top of the Pops" in 1974 when Jack performed the hit "Rebel Rebel". Although not as sensationalized as when Ziggy performed "Starman" on the show two years earlier, the 1974 performance is still remembered as a notable performance for Bowie. Halloween Jack appeared on the artwork of both the album and the "Diamond Dogs" single. Halloween Jack was also present on the subsequent <span class="italic">Diamond Dogs</span> tour, which was incrediby theatrical and expensive. Midway through the tour, Bowie decided to cut expenses and decided to strip the tour down to its bare essentials, removing the massive set used up until that point. The rest of the tour also featured more soulful and R&B inspired renditions of songs, a product of Bowie's growing interest in those genres and away from glam rock. This decision effectively killed Halloween Jack since Bowie decided to cut his hair shorter and wear more professional clothes for the rest of the tour, then renamed the "Soul Tour".</p>
